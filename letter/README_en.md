# Letterhead (Science Institute - University of Iceland)

Here is an Icelandic and English versions of a letter material for The Science Institute.

Theese variables must be set
* `NAME`
* `TITLE` (for the Icelandic version)
* `TITLEENG` (for the English version)
* `TEL`
* `EMAIL`
and replace signature.png with the your signature.

For an Icelandic version set the `ICELANDIC` variable as `true`, but `false` for the English version.

It is best to put the header and signature in a folder that stores templates (e.g. ~/Templates) and change the corresponding lines, then it is enough to have one copy of the header and signature and no need to copy those files to all folders.
